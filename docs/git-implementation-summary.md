# Git Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the Git workflow implementation for the TFN Artist project and provides guidance on how to get started with the new branching strategy.

## Changes Implemented

1. **Updated .gitignore**
   - Added additional rules for Laravel/Vue.js projects
   - Included OS-specific files
   - Added rules for IDE helper files
   - Added rules for compiled assets and logs

2. **Created Git Workflow Documentation**
   - Defined branching strategy based on GitFlow
   - Established branch naming conventions
   - Documented workflow for feature development
   - Outlined release and hotfix processes
   - Provided best practices for commits and code reviews

3. **Added GitHub Templates**
   - Pull Request template
   - Feature request template
   - Bug report template
   - Issue template configuration

4. **Set Up Continuous Integration**
   - Created GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
   - Configured separate jobs for backend and frontend tests
   - Included code quality checks (linting, static analysis)

## Getting Started

To start using the new Git workflow:

1. **Ensure you have the latest changes**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create the develop branch if it doesn't exist**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b develop
   git push -u origin develop
   ```

3. **Protect branches in GitHub**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to Settings > Branches
   - Add branch protection rules for `main` and `develop`
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging

4. **Set up Git hooks (optional)**
   - Install Husky:
     ```bash
     npm install husky --save-dev
     npx husky install
     npm set-script prepare "husky install"
     ```
   - Add pre-commit hook:
     ```bash
     npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm run lint && vendor/bin/pint --test"
     ```
   - Add pre-push hook:
     ```bash
     npx husky add .husky/pre-push "npm test && vendor/bin/pest"
     ```

## Next Steps

1. **Team Training**
   - Share the Git workflow documentation with the team
   - Conduct a brief training session to ensure everyone understands the new workflow
   - Address any questions or concerns

2. **Migrate Existing Work**
   - If you have ongoing work in other branches, consider how to migrate them to the new branching structure
   - For features in progress, create new feature branches from develop

3. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Observe how the team adapts to the new workflow
   - Be prepared to make adjustments based on feedback and practical experience
   - Review the workflow after a few weeks to identify any pain points or areas for improvement

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Consider using Git LFS** for large binary files if your project includes assets like images, videos, or audio files.

2. **Implement semantic versioning** for your releases to clearly communicate the nature of changes.

3. **Set up automated deployment** to staging and production environments based on branch activity.

4. **Use commit signing** to verify the authenticity of commits.

5. **Consider using Conventional Commits** format for more structured commit messages.

## Conclusion

The implemented Git workflow provides a solid foundation for collaborative development on the TFN Artist project. By following these guidelines, the team can maintain a clean and organized repository, facilitate collaboration, and ensure code quality.

Remember that a Git workflow should serve the team, not the other way around. Be open to adjusting the workflow as needed based on the team's experience and feedback.
